# NTRUEncrypt
An implementation of NTRUEncrypt in C++

This is an implementation of NTRUEncrypt algorithm. 

Used libraries are
- iostream;
- string;
- ctime.

It contains
- mathematical description;
- polynomial generators;
- open key generator;
- encryption function;
- decryption function;
- string to polynomial and back converter.

It is constructed as a console application in order to demostrate functionality. Generally speaking, this is a list of necessary functions, including mathematical, sufficient to implement message encryption and decryption via NTRUEncrypt.

Some specific information on exploitation is provided as comments before the main() function.
